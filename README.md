Such as here for example where when the computer wins it adds a point and further more shows what you the user chose and what the comptuer chose as well along with saying who won the round.

This also applies to whether the roud was a draw where no one gets a point.

The game can go on continously and either you or the computer can keep racking up as many points as you want.
